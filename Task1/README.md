# Titanic Survival Analysis 

This repository presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) based on the Titanic dataset. The objective is to uncover meaningful patterns within the data and develop a reliable model to predict passenger survival outcomes.

The project includes comprehensive sections covering data exploration, survival analysis. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib are used for data preprocessing, visualization.

# Summary of Insights:
The Titanic dataset (891 passengers) reveals significant patterns in survival outcomes influenced by factors such as age, class, gender, and family size.

- Survival Overview: Out of 891 passengers, 342 (38.4%) survived and 549 (61.6%) drowned. The available lifeboats could accommodate only about 53% of all passengers, highlighting the limited evacuation capacity.

- Age and Survival: Passenger ages ranged from 0.17 to 80 years, with an average of 29.9 years. Survivors tended to be slightly younger (mean age 28.2) compared to non-survivors.

- Gender and Title Influence: Women, especially those titled “Mrs.”, had the highest survival rates, while over 80% of men (“Mr.”) and all clergy (“Rev.”) perished.

- Cabin and Deck Patterns: Most passengers lacked cabin information. Among those with known cabins, the ‘D’ deck had the highest survival rate, whereas ‘A’ deck—closest to the lifeboats—had surprisingly lower survival rates.

- Family Size Impact: Passengers traveling in small families (2–4 members) had a better chance of survival than singles or large families. All members of the two largest families (sizes 8 and 11) drowned.

- Class and Embarkation Trends:

• First-class passengers had the highest survival proportion, even though many older males perished.

• Third-class passengers had the lowest survival rate, with most casualties among men.

• Most passengers (914) embarked from Southampton, where the fatality rate was highest. Passengers from Cherbourg had over 50% survival, while Queenstown passengers were mainly third-class.

- Overall Insight: Survival was not determined by a single factor but by an interaction of class, gender, age, family size, and embarkation point. Generally, young first-class women traveling with small families from Cherbourg had the best chances of survival.
